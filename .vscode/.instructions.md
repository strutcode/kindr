This project contains a community assistance web application called "Kindr" with the following specifications.

# Core Features

1. Authentication

   - Email/password registration and login using Supabase Auth
   - Social authentication options (Google, Facebook)
   - Profile creation with verification steps
   - User preference settings for notification radius

2. Request Management

   - Create, edit, and delete assistance requests
   - Rich text editor for request descriptions
   - Category selection (Free stuff, Help needed, Skills offered)
   - Subcategories under main categories (Free stuff -> Hygiene, Food; Help needed -> Transportation, Moving; Skills offered -> Tutoring, Handyman)
   - Duration estimation (15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day)
   - Skills required tags
   - Optional compensation details
   - Image upload capability

3. Location Services

   - Geolocation-based filtering
   - Custom radius selection
   - Map visualization of nearby requests

4. Reputation System

   - Users start as an unknown with no points
   - When completing a request, both users are asked to provide feedback
   - Feedback should be presented as a series of options such as "No show"/"Late"/"On Time", "Helpful"/"Unhelpful", "As described"/"Not as described"
   - Positive points are awarded for good behavior, for example 10 good points for providing a free item, 5 good points for being on time
   - Negative points for bad behavior, such as 5 points for being late or not showing up
   - Profiles should display a ratio of positive to negative points as well as an "unknown" ratio if the points are under a threshold of 100
   - Display reputation as a bar with a green section for good points, a red section for bad points and a grey section for unknown

# Backend Requirements (Supabase)

1. Database schema

   - The database is a Supabase project based on PostgreSQL
   - Read migrations from the `supabase/migrations` folder top understand the existing database schema
   - Add new migrations to the `supabase/migrations` when changes to the database schema are required

2. Edge Functions

   - Edge functions are server-side functionssaved in Supabase
   - Edge functions run in a Deno environment and should provide a web server for requests
   - Use existing edge functions from the `supabase/functions` folder where appropriate
   - Create new edge functions for server-side logic that requires security not provided by Postgres row level security
   - Create new edge functions in the `supabase/functions` folder using a subfolde representing the function name

# Testing Requirements

1. Implement comprehensive testing using Vitest

   - Component unit tests
   - Integration tests for core features
   - API interaction tests
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Geolocation service tests

The application should prioritize user privacy, ease of use, and community building while maintaining high performance and security standards.
