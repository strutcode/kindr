# Security Guide

## Overview

Kindr implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure safe community interactions.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Supabase Auth Integration
- Email/password authentication with secure password requirements
- OAuth integration with Google (Facebook can be added)
- JWT-based session management with automatic token refresh
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables

### User Permissions
- Users can only access and modify their own data
- Public read access for active community requests
- Secure user validation through edge functions

## Data Protection

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- XSS protection through HTML sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- File upload restrictions (type, size, location)

### Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- User-specific request counting
- Automatic cleanup of rate limit data

### Data Encryption
- All data transmitted over HTTPS
- Database encryption at rest through Supabase
- Secure storage of authentication tokens

## Privacy Controls

### Location Privacy
- Users control their location sharing preferences
- Approximate location display (no exact addresses)
- Optional location services with fallback

### Profile Privacy
- Users control what information is publicly visible
- Email addresses hidden from anonymous users
- Optional phone number sharing

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always validate user input**:
   ```typescript
   import { SecurityService } from '@/services/security'
   
   const { valid, sanitized, errors } = SecurityService.validateTextInput(userInput)
   if (!valid) {
     // Handle validation errors
   }
   ```

2. **Check user permissions**:
   ```typescript
   import { useSecurity } from '@/composables/useSecurity'
   
   const { checkPermission } = useSecurity()
   const permission = await checkPermission('update', 'request', requestId)
   ```

3. **Use CSRF tokens for sensitive operations**:
   ```typescript
   const { csrfToken } = useSecurity()
   // Include token in form submissions
   ```

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** with a mix of characters
2. **Enable location services** only when comfortable
3. **Report suspicious behavior** through the app
4. **Keep your profile information** up to date
5. **Be cautious when sharing** personal information

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
- Email: security@kindr.app
- Include detailed description and steps to reproduce
- Do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities

### Response Process
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. Investigate and assess severity
3. Develop and test fix
4. Deploy fix and notify users if necessary
5. Follow up with reporter

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual request patterns
- Input validation failures
- Rate limit violations

### Manual Reviews
- Regular security audits
- Code reviews for security implications
- Third-party security assessments

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data retention and deletion policies
- User consent management

### Platform Security
- Regular security updates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security settings
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Optional security enhancements
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_CSRF_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

### Supabase Security Settings
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Configure proper authentication providers
- Set up storage bucket policies
- Enable audit logging

## Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- Review security logs
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness

### Monthly
- Update dependencies
- Review user permissions
- Audit database access patterns

### Quarterly
- Security code review
- Penetration testing
- Update security documentation
- Review incident response procedures
