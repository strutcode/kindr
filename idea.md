Create a new web application that helps individuals connect with each other for community help. Similar to "buy nothing" groups these connections could be for a variety of purposes.

Example posts:

- Someone to accompany them home after a medical procedure
- Someone to help with a minor repair -- "my faucet is leaking"
- Quick assistance with a common task (e.g., "Need an extra pair of hands to move this heavy box for 10 minutes")
- Requests for very specific, immediate consumables (e.g., "If anyone has shampoo/conditioner they don't like I can use it," or "does anyone have this kind of battery they don't need, low charge ok")

Key features:

- User registration and authentication
- The ability to view existing requests and create new ones
- Local or even hyper-local filtering (e.g. within 2 miles or 4 blocks)
- Additional filtering criteria based on things like the amount of time required, special skills required, or compensation
- A reputation system where users can get publicly visible points for providing help or answering posts while expending points for taking free items or accepting help

Technical requirements:

- Supabase for hosting, database and edge functions
- Vue 3 and Tailwinds CSS for the user interface
- Typescript for all code
- Vite as a build system
- Vitest for unit testing
